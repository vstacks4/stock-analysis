# Stock-Analysis Challenge

## OverView of the Project
*This project allowed us to summarize analyze various ticker stockers throught the use of macros using Excel VBA. Through the project we were able to summarize data over a large dataset and through the use of conditional formatting the results were clear and visual. Lastly, we were able to refactor the the macros to determine a more efficient way to write the code and thus run quicker*

## Purpose and Background
The purpose of this project was to introduce Excel VBA and its use to summarize data over a large dataset. More importantly, the analysis can be repeated easily thru the use of the macros and other techniques. This module provided us our first introduction to writing code with all its intracacies. The refractoring exercises gave us an opportunity to streamline the code and thus decreasing the processisng time associated with running the macro. 

## Results
After the completion of the refactory challenge the macro did run quicker than the orginal VBA. The code was more streamlined and we able to copy much of the code from the original Green_stocks exercise with minor modifications. The original code ran at approx. .83 and the new refactored was much loweer as seen by the submitted screenshots.  

### Advantages and Challenges with Refactoring Code
Refactoring code in general does allow for one to streamline the original code make for a more efficient process. This is particularly important if the dataset is very large and the analysis will be completed frequently. With that said, it is very easy to make mistakes when refactoring the code, leading to processing errors. Additionally, sometimes it can be diffucult and frustrating to find those errors once they occur.

### Advantages and Challenges with Refactoring the Original vs Refactored

### Advantages
The advantages of the original code was that the module walk us through it step by step. The instructions were easy to follow and the videos helped significantly. The advantages of the VBA was that we could reuse a significant amount of the original code and we were provided with start-up code that provided additional guidance.
### Disadvantages
The disadvantage of the original code was lack of familiarity that made this module very difficult. The disadvantages of the refactored VBA were more pronounced. There were a number  of errors that made debugging difficult for someone who is a novice with no previous exposure. Additionally, through trial and error and consultation with others I had to make modifications in some of the starter code that was provided. For example, I had to change some of the code from single to double for the macro to run.
